# Yohson KINGC README en\_US

Hello, I'm Jin Yucheng (Yohson KING), nice to meet you!

I have a more familiar name - "GhostKINGC". To be exact, I'm going to start doing it in 2020. NET developed, C# language elegant let me love. NET technology development. In October 2023, I started as a video blogger and published my first series of tutorials in the form of a retelling of the book WPF, which was loved and supported by developers. Now I am mainly engaged in the development, teaching and research activities of C# language and WPF technology, and am committed to making more open source and open technology tutorials for the Chinese community.

## About me

I'm not exactly a programmer. My professional identity is a graphic visual designer, mainly engaged in advertising design, visual design, UI design and other work. I've always been a multi-creator:

- üíª C#/.NET Technology developer
- ‚úè Graphic visual designer
- üéµ The sound mixer
- üé§ Popular singing and dancing

In addition, there are a variety of scattered technical, artistic and other interests. To maintain this diversity and love, I think is the greatest value in my life. Here is me (left) and my partner (right).
